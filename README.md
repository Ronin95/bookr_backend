This project features the backend section of my full-stack project Bookr.
In the backend you can find django apps.
Those apps are account, websearch, pdfchat, pdfUpload, agent and kanban.
Further there are media for the uploaded PDFs and bookr folder for the general settings.

Websearch, pdfchat and agent all take in user text input, run through an LLM python code
and with the help of a serializer return a string output to the UI.
Account helps register / login the user.

I have also uploaded a notes.txt file. In that you can find various links and inspirations I have used in creating this project.

Please feel free to leave feedback. I am actively working on improving my django skills.
Thanks
